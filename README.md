# Website-Blocker
A website blocker is a tool that helps you block access to specific websites or categories of websites. It is typically used to limit access to distracting or inappropriate websites such as social media, online gaming, or adult content.
Some website blockers allow you to create custom blocklists of specific websites, while others use pre-defined categories to block entire groups of websites.
